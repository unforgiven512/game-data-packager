slipstream documentation is as follows

    slipstream(deb,relpath,file1,file2...)
         insert file1,file2... into the deb, under the
         path 'relpath', relative to the package root, e.g.:
             slipstream(deb, 'usr/share/doc', 'README', 'copyright')
                 => /usr/share/doc/README
                 => /usr/share/doc/copyright

However, the relpath argument is passed through to `slipstream_file`,
which names it locally `destpath`, copies the file to that location
and invokes md5sum on it.

Thus, if relpath is a directory, md5sum will be called for it and will
fail.

It is actually used by the doom code as relative file path, i.e.

    slipstream(deb,src,file1,file2...)
         insert file1,file2... into the deb, as filename
         'src', relative to the package root, e.g.:
             slipstream(deb, 'usr/share/doc/file', 'README', 'copyright')
                 => /usr/share/doc/file

The file contents will be that of the last argument, 'copyright'.

Both quake3 and rott need to insert multiple files. Each branch has solved
this bug in a different way.
