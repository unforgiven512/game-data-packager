TODO:

	* do away with ./Makefile and build entirely from debian/rules
		* reconsider: why do this?
	* re-add quake3 support (currently in a branch)
	* provide configurable methods for elevating privs

	nicer -i behaviour
		support (somehow) installing a generated .deb and throwing
		it away (current behaviour is now, generate and store in	
		$(pwd) if otherwise unspecified; impossible not to preserve
		generated file)
