Description: Installer for game data files
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licenced in
 different ways, such that only one half can be distributed
 in Debian.
 .
 game-data-packager is a tool which builds .deb files for game
 data which cannot be distributed in Debian (such as
 commercial game data).
 .
 At the moment, game-data-packager has support for building debs
 for Doom games (Doom, Doom 2 and Final Doom); Quake;
 Quake III Arena; Heretic; Rise of the Triad and Wolfenstein 3D.
