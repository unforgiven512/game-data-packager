game-data-packager (23) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * game-data-packager up to version 22 has used sudo(1)
    in order to obtain the necessary privileges to install
    the generated .deb file.  This scheme works only if the
    user has configured their sudoers file appropriately.
    Therefore, from version 23 onwards, game-data-packager will
    use su(1) instead. Consequently, a user must supply the root
    password to install the generated .deb, not their own.
    .
    We plan to make game-data-packager more flexible by supporting
    either method of privilege escalation (or other means of
    installing the generated package) in the future.
